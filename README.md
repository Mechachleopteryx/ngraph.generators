Graph generators
=================
This module generates various graphs. It is part of larger [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph)
family. If you something not as simple as generated graphs, please check out 
[ngraph.sparce-collection](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.sparse-collection) repository
which contains graphs from University of Florida collection.
